# Common Introduction questions

These are some of the most common general interview question, I've faced no matter the company interviewing for.

It's best to have a rough idea of the points for each question that help your case. Often times I faced

1. Tell me about yourself/Introduce yourself.
1. Describe your current role & responsibilities.
1. How many yrs of exp and relevant yrs of exp.
