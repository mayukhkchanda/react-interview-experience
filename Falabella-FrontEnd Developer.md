## HackerEarth Online Assessment -> Technical Round -> Technical Managerial round

I got this oppurtuinity from an HackerEarth online test. I cleared the test after which I was offered an interview.

This interview was not based on any framework. All questions asked were based on Vanilla JavaScript. Including the coding questions too. I've shared the Technical Interview round experience first followed by Technical Managerial Interview round.

- ## General Questions

  This round was an open discussion round with a technical manager. First the manager began by introducing himself and about the team he was interviewing for. Most of the questions asked in this round were behavioural question.

  The manager wanted to know about the approach I talk towards solving my problems. Whether I come up with an optimised solution first or brute-force to optimal approach.

  Below were some of the questions that I was asked. It was more of a behavioural round than a techincal, mostly to figure out if I would be fit for the team or not.

  1. Introduce yourself.
  1. Role/Responsibilities in current organisation?
  1. Total years of experience and relevant experience ?
  1. Why do you want to switch ?
  1. Do you prefer to work in team or alone ?
  1. Brief about a challenging situation at work and how did you resolve it.
  1. What is your ideal work environment ?
  1. What do you look for in a team member?
  1. how do you expect your ideal manager to be ?

  However, there was 1 coding question that was asked and I was just told to give and approach to the solution. The code for the same was not aksed. The problem statement with Leetcode link is given below.

  LeetCode Question Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/?msclkid=931e1c3bceae11ec9d9bd7a3bd40c5cc

        Problem Statement

        Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
        An input string is valid if:

        Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
        Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

        Example 1:
            Input: s = "()"
            Output: true
        Example 2:
            Input: s = "()[]{}"
            Output: true
        Example 3:
            Input: s = "(]"
            Output: false
