# Public Sapient React-Js coding question

> Given an API https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/ use it to fetch data and render the list. Fetch data using async-await inside useEffect(must create the async function inside the useEffect, since passing async function to the useEffect will give an warning). Use a loading state to show loading indicator while the data is being fetched.

    Follow up-
    1. Move the data fetching logic to a custom hook.
    1. Create cards for the each of the item in the list displaying 3 cards in each row and center the items inside the card vertically and horizontally.
