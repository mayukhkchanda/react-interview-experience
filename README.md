# My Interview experience for React Developer

This repository contains all of my interview experiences for React Developer role. While I tried my best to jot down most of the questions that were asked, some might have been missed. I suggest you use this as a general guide as to what type of questions might be asksed in the interview.

## Key points that need to be addressed:

- Before diving into framework specific questions, get a good depth and understanding of JavaScript basics. I would suggest starting with [Namaste JavaScript üôè Course - JS Video Tutorials by Akshay Saini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pN6jk0uUrD8&list=PLlasXeu85E9cQ32gLCvAvr9vNaUccPVNP&index=1&t=0s). This is a must for JS interviews in general as most of the questions asked in the interviews are covered here.

- Online assessment will be taken on some platform like HackerRank or HackerEarth. These often consists of JavaScript output mcq questions, followed by framework specific mcqs, followed by 1 or 2 JavaScript coding questions. For this, I would suggest you to practice JavaScript output questions on these platforms.

- For React Framework questions the, study the original docs very well. You should make your self familiar with a state management library like Redux or Flow. Along, with Webpack and Babel. Below are some of the good resources you can refer.

  - React Official docs: https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html

    Note: The official doc is the best way to get started to react and most of the interview questions will be from the official docs. Still I've mentioned an Udemy course that I had taken while starting out.

  - React JS Udemy course(not affiliated): https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux-tutorial/

    Note: This udemy link is not affiliated and I earn nothing if you buy from this link. My goal is only to help you. Personally, I have used my Organisations udemy access to take this course. And I haven't followed any other course so I can't quite recommend you anything else. Please, do some research and if you find anything worth adding please create a pull request for it.

  - Webpack Youtube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpGLUVbqoYQ
  - Babel official docs: https://babeljs.io/docs/en?msclkid=58ce3b3eceb711ecb3bf645a84d1ff63
  - Redux official docs: https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts

- You might find a few of the JavaScript questions to be repeated. This was not intentional. Some of these questions were repeated among different interviuews that I gave.

- I jotted down some of the frequent JavaScript questions and their implementation in this [blog](https://mayukhkchanda.github.io/js-interview-questions/).

- For behavioural questions, have a rough idea about the points that help your case.

I hope this guide helps you in your preparations. My best wishes are with you.

Thanks for reading.üòä
